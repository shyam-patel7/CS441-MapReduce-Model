# Homework 2
### Description: you will gain experience with the map/reduce computational model.
### Grade: 7% + bonus up to 3% for deploying your map/reduce program at [AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr).
#### You can obtain this Git repo using the command git clone git@bitbucket.org:cs441_fall2019/homework2.git. You cannot push your code into this repo, otherwise, your grade for this homework will be ZERO!

## Preliminaries
If you have not already done so as part of your first homework, you must create your account at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), a Git repo management system. It is imperative that you use your UIC email account that has the extension @uic.edu. Once you create an account with your UIC address, BibBucket will assign you an academic status that allows you to create private repos. Bitbucket users with free accounts cannot create private repos, which are essential for submitting your homeworks and the course project. Your instructor created a team for this class named [cs441_Spring2019](https://bitbucket.org/cs441_spring2019/). Please contact your TA [Mr.Mohammed Siddiq](msiddi56@uic.edu) from your **UIC.EDU** account and they will add you to the team repo as developers, since they already have the admin privileges. Please use your emails from the class registration roster to add you to the team and you will receive an invitation from BitBucket to join the team. Since it is still a large class, please use your UIC email address for communications or Piazza and avoid emails from other accounts like funnybunny1992@gmail.com. If you don't receive a response within 12 hours, please contact us via Piazza, it may be a case that your direct emails went to the spam folder.

In case you have not done so, you will install [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) with your academic license, the JDK, the Scala runtime and the IntelliJ Scala plugin, the [Simple Build Toolkit (SBT)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html) and make sure that you can create, compile, and run Java and Scala programs. Please make sure that you can run [Java monitoring tools](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr025.html) or you can choose a newer JDK and tools if you want to use a more recent one.

Please set up your account with [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/). Using your UIC email address will enable you to receive free credits for running your jobs in the cloud.

You will use logging and configuration management frameworks. You will comment your code extensively and supply logging statements at different logging levels (e.g., TRACE, INFO, ERROR) to record information at some salient points in the executions of your programs. All input and configuration variables must be supplied through configuration files -- hardcoding these values in the source code is prohibited and will be punished by taking a large percentage of points from your total grade! You are expected to use [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) and [SLFL4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) for logging and [Typesafe Conguration Library](https://github.com/lightbend/config) for managing configuration files. These and other libraries should be exported into your project using your script [build.sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Basic-Def-Examples.html). These libraries and frameworks are widely used in the industry, so learning them is the time well spent to improve your resume.

When writing your program code in Scala, you should avoid using **var**s to create global side-effects and while/for loops that iterate over collections using [induction variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_variable). Instead, you should learn to use collection methods **map**, **flatMap**, **foreach**, **filter** and many others with lambda functions, which make your code linear and easy to understand. Also, avoid mutable variables at all cost. Points will be deducted for having many **var**s and inductive variable loops without explanation why mutation is needed in your code - you can always do without it.
